 <h2> <strong> Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (‚Äúfolding‚Äù) and kami (‚Äúpaper‚Äù). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it </strong> </h2>
 
 <br>

 <h2> <strong> Origami helps develop hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills and mental concentration. Use of the hands directly stimulates areas of the brain. ... Paper folding challenges us at the cognitive level as we follow instructions, learning new skills and activities. Physically our hands become active </strong></h2>
